## Restaurant Website

This project is a website for a restaurant, originally created for The Odin Project restaurant page assignment. Instead of opting for a traditional multi-page layout, I've designed it as a single-page website with a scrolling feature for seamless navigation.

## Technologies Used
- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Usage

- **Home**: Scrolls to the initial section of the website.
- **Menu**: Scrolls to the menu section, showcasing four main dishes.
- **Contact**: Scrolls to the reservation form and the restaurant's location.
